# DCU Timetable

A simple Android application for students of Dublin City University (DCU) to
quickly retrieve their online timetables on the move, without the hassle of
having to go through the various cumbersome methods of finding it (either
through the DCU website or Moodle).

Although right now this app is fairly basic, and only allows you to look at the
online version through your phones built-in browser, future improvements will
include:

+ Storage of your timetable locally, allowing access when no network is
  available and also saving battery.
+ Parsing of the timetable data for much improved display on your mobile device.

Any suggestions for features are welcome!
