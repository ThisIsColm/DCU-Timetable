            <p>Sick of having to trudge through the DCU website or Moodle to
            find your timetable when you're on the move? So were we, so we
            fixed it.</p>

            <p>Developed by a group of CA1 students (so far; you can help on <a
                    href="http://github.com/garmur/DCU-Timetable">GitHub</a>), <strong>DCU
            Timetable</strong> is an Android app for finding your online class
            timetable when you need it, all from your mobile phone.</p>

            <p>With it you can easily grab your online timetable anywhere on the
            go. It's still in the early stages though, and planned features in
            the near future include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The ability to store your timetable locally, to save both
                network usage & battery power.</li>
                <li>Better display of your timetables, more suited to viewing
                on your mobile device.</li>
                <li>Option to track your attendance by using either timed
                notifications when you can <em>"check in"</em> or automatically
                through your devices GPS. (wishful thinking)</li>
